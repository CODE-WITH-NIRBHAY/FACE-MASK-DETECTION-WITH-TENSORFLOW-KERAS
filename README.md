### 🤖 **What is it?**
This cutting-edge AI solution uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect whether people are wearing masks or not, all while analyzing live video feed. With **OpenCV** for face detection and **TensorFlow** for deep learning, the system can instantly determine if a person is following health protocols.

**Whether it's for:**
- 🏢 Smart Surveillance Systems
- 🎥 Real-time Video Streams
- 🏪 Public Spaces Monitoring
- 👨‍⚕️ Automated Health Compliance

This project is your go-to solution for fast, accurate, and scalable mask detection! 🔥

### 🏗️ **How It Works?**

1. **Train the Model**: 
    - **Input**: A dataset of images with faces wearing masks and without masks. 
    - **Output**: A powerful model that classifies faces into two categories: "With Mask" or "Without Mask".
    - **Behind the scenes**: A CNN extracts features from the images, learns, and adjusts to accurately make predictions.

2. **Deploy the Model for Real-time Predictions**:
    - **Input**: A live webcam feed of faces.
    - **Output**: Real-time labels and predictions on whether the person is wearing a mask, displayed on your screen.

### 🚀 **Getting Started - It’s Easy!**

#### 1️⃣ **Training the Model**
To get started, you’ll need a dataset of face images with and without masks. The **train.py** script will help you preprocess and train your model to detect faces in either of the two classes.

- **Step 1**: Organize your dataset:
    ```
    dataset/
    ├── with_mask/
    └── without_mask/
    ```

- **Step 2**: Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

The model will be trained and saved as `face_mask_model.h5`. Simple as that! 🧑‍💻

#### 2️⃣ **Start the Real-time Prediction System**
Once your model is trained, it’s time to run the prediction system!

- **Step 1**: Ensure you have the trained `face_mask_model.h5` file ready.
- **Step 2**: Run the real-time face detection script:
    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```

Your webcam will open, and the system will automatically detect and classify faces, displaying whether the person is wearing a mask or not in real time. 🎥
